# KUET-MINDS Official Documentation Repository

## About

This repository contains the official curriculum documentation and learning materials for **KUET-MINDS** - a comprehensive educational program covering Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. Our structured approach ensures students progress from fundamentals to advanced concepts through hands-on projects and practical implementations.

## Current Version: v1.1.0.0

### Version Format
We follow semantic versioning for our documentation:
- **Major.Minor.Patch.Build** (e.g., v1.0.0.0)
- **Major (1)**: Complete curriculum overhauls or new specialization tracks
- **Minor (0)**: New courses, significant content additions, or structural changes
- **Patch (0)**: Content updates, corrections, and improvements
- **Build (0)**: Minor fixes, typos, and formatting adjustments

### What's Included in v1.1.0.0
- Complete Machine Learning Syllabus (3 Levels)
- Natural Language Processing Curriculum (3 Levels) 
- Computer Vision Syllabus (3 Levels)
- Structured learning paths with prerequisites
- Hands-on projects and evaluation frameworks
